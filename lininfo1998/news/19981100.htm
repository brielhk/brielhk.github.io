    has lots of HP. However his attack is not very strong, so it is as strong as about a 
    Unlogliant. So far I see he will drop about 250 adena only. He is located near the Chaotic

    Due to the growth of Lineage users, today Lineage adds one more T1 Line. Now Lineage have

    Secound) bandwidth. Lineage is planning to expand the Lineage Network to more than 5 mbps 
    which can handle more than 1000 users together by the end of this year.<br>

    Message of Admin(Linmaster):<br>
    <font color="#80FFFF"><tt>Hi.<br>
    <br>
    Lineage server backbone network has added 1 more T1 line today.<br>
    I expect that this will help to reduce lags. Now lineage network can handle arround 600 
    concurrent users. <br>
    I am planning to expand lineage network to more than 5 Mbps which can handle more than 
    1000 users until the end of this year.<br>

    I will save comments for your interests... <br>
    <br>
    But, please do me a favor. It is also benefit to you.<br>
    Before lineage server restart for update, I will upload update <br>
    patch file for upgrade on lineage homepage download menu.<br>
    <br>
    Please try to download update patch file first before you try to <br>
    log in lineage. Down load update patch file and extract to lineage<br>
    home directory. and later (after you do this job) try to log in.<br>
    This will help to reduce lineage server network usage that helps<br>
    play lineage less lag. and takes less time to get update files..<br>

    </strong></em></font>Message from Admin (Linmaster):<font color="#80FF80"><em><strong><br>
    </strong></em></font><font color="#80FFFF"><tt>Hi. lineage users.<br>
    <br>
    I am very sorry that I broke user's promise. 1st stage update works are getting in wrap up 
    status, but, it needs few more days. Every programmers and designers are working up all 
    night, but<br>
    it takes more days than I thought.<br>
    <br>
    For me, I would like to update later than 14th Nov. since new T1 line will be added to 
    lineage server,(^^) but it seems update will be possible on 7th or 8th Nov.<br>
    <br>
    For the download jam whenever lineage update starts, I would like to suggest alternative 
    way of download. When lineage start to update thousand user's are trying to download by 
    active download method. (just tring to connect). but it takes more time. because it is not 
    compressed. <br>
    <br>
    Next update, I will make an upgrade patch file first and link it on the lineage homepage 
    download site. So please tring to download update patch file first before you connect to 
    lineage service. It will save lineage server network usage and lags alot. So the result 
    will be less traffic through server network, means less lag. and downloading patch file is 
    much faster than active download.<br>
    <br>
    Please trying to download patch file first before you trying to connect lineage for next 
    update.<br>
    <br>
    My deep appologies for delayed update.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you very much.<br>
