        litter bit stronger than normal blockhead Their location is showed below:<br>
        <img src="traintip.jpg" alt="The 2 Blockhead" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="220"></li>
      <li>We can train to level 4 within 10 minutes and train to level 8 within an hour by hitting 
        the 2 blockhead above.</li>
