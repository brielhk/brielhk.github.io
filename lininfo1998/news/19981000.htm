    </strong></em></font><font color="#80FFFF"><tt>Hi! This is Admin.<br>
    <br>
    Recently lineage service environment(Lag) became pretty bad. It is because of Korean side 
    network bacame kind a unstable. Normal data communication doesn't effect that much but the 
    interactive game like lineage effected alot. Giga-play game like lineage need at least 
    less than 200ms ping time to play normaly, and if it exceed 500ms it is almost impossible 
    to play. When I have analyzed during last few days ping time, it sometimes exceeded 300ms 
    very often. I feel very sorry for this situation. I am currently complaining to my Network 
    provider and trying to stable the network.<br>
    <br>
    I want to appreciate that lineage users are growing real fast. I will expand network and 
    server to cover more users with high quality service. It will be 4 or 5 T1 network will 
    tied up until the end of this year. One or two T1 will be added in next month.<br>
    <br>
    I will seperate the network dedicated to update only so that when lineage is updated 
    normal service does not take effects due to download jam. I am trying to set it up before 
    coming main land update. I am currently scheduling this update network install with 
    network provider, and I am sorry that I can not give you a definite answer now.<br>
    <br>
    I will notice as soon as scheduling is fixed.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you very much.<br>

    <p><font color="#80FF80"><em><strong>Regulations of Restore Item and Character</strong></em></font><font color="#80FFFF"><tt><br>
    Hi. Lineage users.<br>
    <br>
    My deep appologies that I was not able to process it despite of <br>
    many request.<br>
    <br>
    I have restored for your request during last few weeks, but I have encountered some 
    serious problems. Some users started to request false data (cheating) and the other user 
    started to send me strong protest mail, and the worst situation is , since I have to 
    operate user data db server to veryfy user's data in order to check backup file. Recently 
    numbers of user got growth very rapidly and db volume has been very huge. So, backup file 
    restoration takes much resaurce of db server. I can not do it on regular service hour 
    because the process started to effects lineage service.<br>
    <br>
    I will set up a seperate db for backup restoration but i need little more time, until then 
    please be patient.<br>
    <br>
    This is the charactor restoration regulation.<br>
    <br>
    1. All data will be restored based on backup file and there is no exception. There is a 
    limit for the item restoring. The limit is +6 for the weapons and +4 for the armors. It 
    means if you lost +9 weapon I will give you +6 wapon for example. I know that you will 
    think that this is unfair. But this way I can prevent cheating for very rare items.<br>
    <br>
    2. I do not have any responsibilty to restore charator which has been delete by 
    themselves. (I can verify that which has been delete by users or communication error.)<br>
    <br>
    However, if you have confidence that your charactor has been deleted due to system fault 
    do not try to make charactor with same charactor name. Please mail me or post it on the 
    board promptly. You have to describe in detail which include your last date when you saw 
    your charactor and use it. I will take discovery time as posting time on email or 
    bulletin.<br>
    <br>
    *[Very Important]*<br>
    If you make a new charactor with same charactor name as before, I can not veryfy the 
    reason of charactor disappear. It deletes the evidence to interpretation. Therefor I can 
    not restore it.<br>
    <br>
    3. Basically I do not restore exps and items loss caused by lag. Lag is not on lineage 
    services responsibilities because it is very dependable on whole network condition. Except 
    for the lineage server or system fault.<br>
    <br>
    4. I do not restore for the situation which has been generated by users side in the game. 
    For example, pk and foul play etc.<br>
    <br>
    5. I will restore your request every wed during regular service hour. I will try to 
    shorten this.<br>
    <br>
    I know that this is not enough. I will try to make a good service.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you very much.<br>
    <br>
    Yours sincerely<br>

    <br>
    Recently I noticed that the chatting manner has been really bad. Today I would like to 
    announce The rules for chatting.<br>
    Before read this board, please try to read lineage user agreement at the homepage. The 
    agreement has been notice from the beginning of commercial service, but location was hard 
    to find. So many users couldn't see it. So, I have moved to middle of registering page. In 
    order to use lineage service user has to agree to follow the agreement. <br>
    <br>
    I am specifying chatting rules here.<br>
    <br>
    1. When user use abuse language on chatting window or by whispering.<br>
    : User's charactor will be banned during 1 week. If it recurs charactor will be banned 
    permanently, and user's account will be suspened during 1 week.<br>
    <br>
    2. When user use abuse laguage to other user's parents on chatting <br>
    window or by whispering.<br>
    : User's charactor will be banned permanently, and user's account will be suspened during 
    1 week. If it recurs user's account will be banned permanently.<br>
    <br>
    3. When user deliberately and continuously abuse or torture other specific user.<br>
    : User's charactor will be banned during 1 week. If it recurs charactor will be banned 
    permanently, and user's account will be suspened during 1 week.<br>
    <br>
    Chatting features in lineage is for a every user's benefit. Every time when you play 
    lineage please remind that this is just a virtual game. Let's try to play lineage in a 
    pleasant manner.<br>
    <br>
    If you find that someone is abusing on you, please capture it and post it on the <a href="http://lineage.ncsoft.co.kr/english/board.htm" target="_blank">board</a> or email to 
    <a href="mailto:linmaster@ncsoft.co.kr">linmaster@ncsoft.co.kr</a>. You can save it by 
    using Screen Capture button on the keybord. Using graphic s/w and Ctrl+V can make you save 
    the captured seen. And attach it on your message.<br>
    <br>
    But if the screen capture is edited, your account will be suspended.<br>

    - Shelobs at 2/F Dungeon, 6 shelobs will stay at a fix place unless people come in.

    <br>
    Now player can share the exp when you hunt with other ppl.<br>
    You do not loose exp even through you were a first hitter.<br>
    But I am asking you that do not interrupt other player's hunting.<br>
    <br>
    I will explain how exp is distributed to group hunters.<br>
    Enjoy group hunting.<br>
    <br>
    - Monster can recognize attacker's character and number of effective hit.<br>
    - Monster give exp to hunters according to the total number of hits.<br>
    - Number of hit is not attempted but effective hit will be counted.<br>
    - The first hitter has double number of hit counted than the other hunter.<br>
    - Even though the first hitter restart the second hitter does not become a first hitter.<br>
    - If all player restart who has attacked and later other player start to attack he will be 
    a new first hitter.<br>
    <br>
    - Mothod 1 - when the first hitter is still existing.<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter A 4 hit<br>
    user B 6 hit<br>
    user C 2 hit<br>
    ---------------------------------------<br>
    Total effective hit 12 hit<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter double number of hit.<br>
    So monster count like this.<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter A 8 hit<br>
    user B 6 hit<br>
    user C 2 hit<br>
    ---------------------------------------<br>
    Total effective hit 16 hit<br>
    <br>
    and the exp for each hunters when monster give 100 exp are<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter A (8*100)/16 = 50<br>
    user B (6*100)/16 = 37.5 --&gt; 37<br>
    user C (2*100)/16 = 12.5 --&gt; 12<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    - Mothod 2 - when there is no first hitter.<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter A 4 hit<br>
    user B 6 hit<br>
    user C 2 hit<br>
    ---------------------------------------<br>
    Total effective hit 12 hit<br>
    <br>
    since there is no first hitter there is no double point.<br>
    and the exp for each hunters when monster give 100 exp are<br>
    <br>
    The first hitter A (4*100)/12 = 33.3 --&gt; 33<br>
    user B (6*100)/12 = 50 <br>
    user C (2*100)/12 = 16.6 --&gt; 16</tt></font><p><font color="#80FF80"><em><strong>Don't

    So far I know 3 ways to the boss room.<br>
    The first way is walk through the 2 paths to the boss room. One of the path is long and 
    hazardous, but honest. The other one is easy but dishonest, there is many traps, and 
    strong monsters.<br>
    The second way is using a golden key to open the door of the boss room. However we can 
    only find this key from the Baphomet when he died. The golden key can only use once.<br>
    The third way is using VERZAR scrolls. Since it is random target and we don't not have 
    ring of teleport control, we need quite a lot of them in order to go to the boss room. On 
    average, we need to spend about 10 VERZAR scrolls to go there. I prefer you should take at 
    least 20 VERZAR scrolls. Otherwise if we are unlucky, we will use all our scrolls and miss 
    the way in the dungeon.<br>

    <td><u><em>How strong is the boss?</em></u><br>
    If you think elder is already very strong, then I don't think I can describe how strong is 
    the boss.<br>
    So far I see the boss have 2 kinds of attack. If we attack it from a long distance, the 
    boss will use &quot;Straight Line&quot; attack. All players on the &quot;Line&quot; will 
    hurt about 20~40 HP.<br>
    If we attack near it, the boss will use &quot;Circle&quot; attack. All players 1~2 steps 
    near the boss will hurt about 60~80HP! I find my dead body after 2.5 seconds when the boss 
    use this kind of attack.<br>
    Also, the boss can summon 5~10 skeletons at once... and there is shelobs near the boss 
    room...<br>

    <td><u><em>What will the boss drop?</em></u><br>
    So far I see the boss will drop two hands sword, ZELGO scrolls, DAIYEN scrolls, VELOX 
    scrolls, ebony wands, orange potions, adena (the max. i saw was 8000!) and golden key.<br>

    <td><u><em>Can we trap the boss?<br>
    </em></u>Yes! We can trap the boss.<br>
    Firstly, we need tons of people to surround the boss. We need to block all the ways of the 
    boss.<br>
    Then, we need a player using long distance attack (like bow &amp; arrows or ebony wand) to 
    attack the boss. The player should then run behind the wall.<br>
    At last, the boss will just face to the player who behind wall. And other players near it 
    can kill it.</td>
